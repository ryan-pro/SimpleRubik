# SimpleRubik
A simple Rubik's Cube-styled game created with Unity. Includes the ability to save and load progress, a timer, and an undo function.

Created as part of a technical assignment; bug fixes and further improvements can be found on the [after-submission](https://github.com/ryan-pro/SimpleRubik/tree/after-submission) branch.
